Female dwarves are every bit as sturdy as their male counterparts, and are seen just as often on the battlefield wielding an axe or warhammer. There have been numerous conflicts between Dwarf and Goblin clans, and with the Dwarves inability to forget a misdeed against them, this has led to a full-blown hatred.",
